# In limbo fMRI package 
This Python package is a supplement to the the paper
``An antidote to the imager's fallacy, or how to identify brain areas that are
in limbo''.

It includes the original code, and, importantly, also a collection of
[NiPype](https://github.com/nipy/nipype) interfacs and workflows that should
make it relatively easy to apply the methods of the paper to your own fMRI
dataset.
